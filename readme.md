### Focus
- Focus of this assignment has been on testing and the users not being able to access models they are not allowed too.
- And ofc clean code.
- Ci has been setup which can be seen in the pr's and test coverage can be seen in the jobs artifacts [coverage](https://44-216110505-gh.circle-artifacts.com/0/home/circleci/project/build/coverage-report/index.html).

And the worklog is [located](https://github.com/mrhn/Centerplan/blob/master/worklog.md)
